## Introduction

Welcome to the realm of Databel, a dynamic telecommunications enterprise renowned for its comprehensive array of call and data services. Our mission? To unlock the enigmatic facets concealed within our churn rate data and gain insights into the pivotal factors influencing customer retention. Examining churn extends beyond merely quantifying its rate; it entails deciphering the reasons behind customer departures and devising effective strategies to mitigate churn. Embark with me on this data-driven expedition as we navigate through the core of our operations, striving to enhance customer allegiance and diminish churn. The analytical tools employed for this exploration are Microsoft PowerBI and Python.

## Problem Statement
With a half-decade presence in the market, Databel has undergone remarkable growth. Nevertheless, mounting competition and evolving consumer preferences have cast a spotlight on our churn rate -the proportion of subscribers discontinuing their memberships monthly or yearly. I have endeavored to identify the root causes of churn and formulate strategies to preserve our most valuable clientele.
They are interested in understanding the prediction of customers that will churn with the dataset provided. A thorough EDA has been done with Microsoft Power BI to investigate the reason for customer churning behavior. However, they are still interested in profiling a potential customer that can churn to reduce the possibility of having churning customers, which was done using Python.
